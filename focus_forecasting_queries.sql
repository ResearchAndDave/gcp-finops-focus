-- Expected Output: Month-over-month amortized cost trends with forecasts
-- Use: Financial planning, budget variance analysis, service-level forecasting
-- Notes:
--   - EffectiveCost represents amortized costs (includes commitment amortization)
--   - Breaks down by Provider, ServiceCategory, ServiceName, ChargeCategory per FOCUS spec
--   - Shows month-over-month trends and forecasts next month based on 6-month average growth

-- NOTES ON FORECASTING BEST PRACTICES
-- ============================================================================
--
-- 1. Choose the right forecast horizon:
--    - Short-term (1-3 months): Use recent trends, higher accuracy
--    - Long-term (6-12 months): Include seasonality, lower accuracy
--
-- 2. Update forecasts regularly:
--    - Run weekly or monthly to capture changing patterns
--    - Adjust for known events (launches, migrations, etc.)
--
-- 3. Communicate uncertainty:
--    - Always provide confidence intervals (low/high estimates)
--    - Explain assumptions to stakeholders
--
-- 4. Validate forecasts:
--    - Compare forecasts to actuals each month
--    - Calculate Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
--    - Adjust models based on performance
--
-- 5. Consider external factors:
--    - Product launches
--    - Marketing campaigns
--    - Infrastructure migrations
--    - Commitment renewals/expirations
--
-- 6. Combine methods:
--    - Use simple linear trends for stable services
--    - Apply seasonality for cyclical patterns
--    - Leverage ML for complex, multi-variable forecasts
--
-- 7. Document assumptions:
--    - Record growth rates, seasonal factors
--    - Note any manual adjustments made
--    - Track forecast accuracy over time
